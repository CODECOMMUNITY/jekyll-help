            <p>Are there any generators that work with pages or collections? I want to auto-generate a page that lists all pages that have a specific tag (like a tag archive but for pages instead of posts). Alternatively, I would like to auto-generate a collection archive (a page showing all pages in the collection). I know how to manually create these archive pages, but is there a way to auto-generate this kind of archive page on build? Ideally, it would work like this <a href="https://github.com/recurser/jekyll-plugins">categories archive plugin</a> but for pages. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>I&#39;m using jekyll for a documentation site (e.g., user guide). There are various sections in the user guide, such as Getting Started, Implementation, Configuration, Troubleshooting. I want to create different lists for pages in these sections. So I&#39;m using tags with pages. I&#39;m autopopulating my navigation sidebar like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  {% assign counter = &#39;0&#39; %}
                {% assign pages = site.pages | sort: &quot;weight&quot;  %}
                {% for page in pages %}
                {% for tag in page.tags %}
                {% if tag == &quot;Implementation&quot; and counter &lt; &#39;9&#39; %}
                {% capture counter %}{{ counter | plus:&#39;1&#39; }}{% endcapture %}
                  &lt;li class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ page.permalink | prepend: site.baseurl }}&quot;&gt;{{page.title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                {% endif %}
                {% endfor %}
                {% endfor %}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre><p>When there are more than 9 topics, I want to say something like &quot;See all&quot; and direct people to an archive view that contains all topics. </p>
<p>Am I going about this the wrong way? Should I be using posts instead? I just don&#39;t want to have to put dates in all my post file names, but maybe I can live with it if posts give me more functionality.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Personally I think this would pretty easily be solved by having the pages be posts and have the permalink setting to be /:category/:name/ or something similar. Otherwise I think you might have to create separate pages manually and populate them yourself. You could possibly use a similar solution to how Jekyll organizes it&#39;s sidenav in the documentation on their website.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>How are pages and posts changing in v3 of Jekyll? I&#39;m not sure I totally understand the difference between the two. What I know is that posts are meant for chronological sorting, they have dates in file names, and they occupy a different namespace (posts instead of pages). Pages are meant to stand alone, they don&#39;t sort by filename, and they have a posts namespace. </p>
<p>But it seems like more features are built around posts (like this plugin) since jekyll was initially conceived as a blogging platform, not a website/user-guide platform. Right?</p>
