            <p>Similar to <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites</a> would it be useful to have a list of some skeleton setups with different frameworks? For instance, I&#39;ve been working on a new site, and there&#39;s still nothing site-specific in the repo, uploading it to a repo as an example and  skeleton setup for Jekyll + Compass + ZURB Foundation 5 could be useful to others.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>What I love about Jekyll is that it doesn&#39;t include any junk. I&#39;d hate to see a change like this.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also a question of maintenance, why incorporate what is essentially third-party code and create a maintenance burden in the process? Someone would have to ensure that there was parity between the upstream third-party code and the Jekyll version. It&#39;s creates dependencies that needn&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>I recently built a Jekyll site using Foundation 5 as a start-point and incorporating it was as easy as opening terminal, cd&#39;ing to my project folder and typing <code>bower install foundation --save</code>. Third-party dependencies should, in my opinion, always be ring-fenced and treated as external assets, not internalised.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@nternetinspired Noone&#39;s suggesting this would ever touch jekyll core in any form. My original concept was more along the line of &#39;themes&#39; in other CMS&#39;s. And yes, you can install foundation that quickly and easily. But in my case, there&#39;s other things going on as well. Setting up jekyll-compass to work, adding RequireJS to support jQuery and Foundation, and a few other bits and pieces. Now I can just clone that repository, fork it and do whatever I need without having to worry about setting up all those dependencies for my new project. Maintenance of each theme would be provided (or not!) by the original creator of it. Since it&#39;s just a git repository of an actual site, there&#39;s no added burden to jekyll at all, and if you don&#39;t want to use any of them then that&#39;s your prerogative.</p>
<p>As an aside, I think that Octopress Ink is probably going to be the way to approach this in the future.</p>
