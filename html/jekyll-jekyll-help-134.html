            <p>Hello,
I&#39;ve had a hell of a time trying to get Jekyll to run on Heroku. I followed the link for getting it to run with Rack 
<a href="http://blog.crowdint.com/2010/08/02/instant-blog-using-jekyll-and-heroku.html">http://blog.crowdint.com/2010/08/02/instant-blog-using-jekyll-and-heroku.html</a> but it didn&#39;t work and the article is over four years old. Right now I&#39;m getting &quot;Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected&quot; but at one point I could push to it but the logs said it crashed without giving a useful reason.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know Rack or Ruby so this has been a very frustrating experience. I&#39;ve tried several different tutorials on getting Jekyll to run on heroku but nothing has worked. Eventually I need to get this running on EC2... I hope it&#39;s not another six hours of work. Please help, this is driving me insane.</p>
<p>Even the static site files by themselves would be fine really.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Okay, I thought the following applied to this situation.
&quot;Have some code that isn&#39;t working? Fork this repo, add your code to a feature branch, push up and create a pull request. Anyone who sees your PR can comment on your code: &quot;Hey, you forgot a curly bracket here!&quot;&quot;
Oh wait, does that mean a PR within the fork?</p>
