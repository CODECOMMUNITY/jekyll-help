            <p>First I have to commend the jekyll team on a great product! Installation and usage is extremely easy, for the most part. Thanks for all of your hard work!</p>
<p>That said, after nearly two-hours of very-frustrated searching, I can&#39;t find any tips on how to auto-start Jekyll. It&#39;s obviously not reasonable for me to have to type into terminal &quot;jekyll serve --source /var/www/my-awesome-site&quot; every single time my server needs to reboot. So how the heck do I auto-start jekyll? I&#39;m new to upstart but over an hour of scripting hasn&#39;t yielded any results.</p>
<p>Can someone please breathe some life into this process before I have to switch to another blogging solution, simply because I can&#39;t get it to auto-start? Thanks!!!!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Glad you are enjoying Jekyll! It is indeed wonderful.</p>
<p>Regarding serving and auto-starting... Jekyll leverages Ruby&#39; Webrick web server for local development serving. The Ruby&#39; Webrick server should not be used for serving public/production. It is designed to provide a simple, local development server.</p>
<p>If your goal is to always have Jekyll running (--watch) and watching for changes to source files in order to re-render the [updated] site, that can be accomplished, i.e. <code>jekyll serve -w</code>.</p>
<p>For automatically starting unix processes at boot time, that is a system administration detail and task unrelated to Jekyll or any other server-side technology.</p>
<p>With that said, one could use <code>cron</code>, or <code>init.d</code>, or now, <code>systemd</code>, or the myriad other runtime management solutions.</p>
<p>Another popular way to dynamically build sites when they change is to use <code>git</code> along with <code>git hooks</code> that triggers <code>jekyll</code> to build and output to the served web directory. Note GitHub does this for you.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>If you&#39;re planning to host the generated site for any prolonged period of time or to the public, I recommend serving the files with an actual web server like nginx or Apache. @jaybe-jekyll beat me to it, but I&#39;ll just reiterate that <code>jekyll serve</code> was meant to be used for development, not production.</p>
<p>For your hosting needs, I also recommend <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>, which can build Jekyll sites without plugins.</p>
