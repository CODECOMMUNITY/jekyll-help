            <p>I can see how you can make a site with multilingual posts using templates like <a href="https://github.com/tristen/multilingual">this</a> (I’m less keen on how it works using tags like in <a href="http://developmentseed.org/blog/multilingual-jekyll-sites/">this</a> example), but can someone give me an example of what a project would look like, if you also had to do multi-lingual pages with long-form text—on top of the posts?</p>
<p>Just a mock dir for starters.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Healthcare.gov provided a great example of a complex multi-lingual Jekyll site, IMO, it&#39;s a real shame they back-pedalled on their commitment to open source and took down the repo.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll find my fork of the original repo here: <a href="https://github.com/nternetinspired/healthcare.gov">https://github.com/nternetinspired/healthcare.gov</a></p>
<p>Please fork it to help try and keep this excellent teaching resource alive. Thanks. </p>

          <div class="body"><p>Ah, so they did go with a folder for each language in root. Hmm.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link, @nternetinspired. And yes, it’s a pain they decided to axe the open source. That and squashing commits from contributors drives me bonkers, too.</p>

<p>That repo has been a treasure-trove of Jekyll tricks for me so I want to keep it alive so that others can learn from it. Long live open source! </p>

          <div class="body"><p>@ndarville I recently did a multi-lingual site. However, my goal was just to &quot;make it work&quot; and I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s any sort of a model of how it should be done. All I did was create direct linkages to a page&#39;s other language mirror and then some conditional statements in the templates. Probably can be done more efficiently.

          <div class="body"><p>The healthcare.gov source really helped—because how the heck is anyone supposed to know that you had to put the translation in <code>_config.yml</code> without an example—so I’ve set up <a href="https://github.com/hafniatimes/hafniatimes.github.io">a project</a> set to be multilingual.</p>
<p>I still have yet to figure out how to go about displaying dates; although <a href="http://sylvain.durand.tf/multilingual-website-with-jekyll/">some guides</a> are available, it always ends up incredibly messy, which isn’t something I fancy. :)</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@ndarville Thanks for the links. I&#39;m going to close this for now, but if you&#39;d like to open a new issue to discuss displaying links in different locale contexts, go right ahead! :smile: </p>
