            <p>I am learning how to build a site with Jekyll. I&#39;m confident that my set up is correct because it had been working well, I&#39;ve been building and pushing changes without any trouble until I added a list of posts to my template.
Then all I see are my pages and even if I edit my pages no changes get reflected on my site after I push my commits.</p>
<p>I encountered this problem at the begining and I deleted my feed.xml file and suddenly everything worked, but the feed.xml is necessary if I have a blog so it&#39;s back.</p>
<p>Could this be what is causing my problem?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s code related. You can view my repository here:
<a href="https://github.com/bitcolorine/Je-suis-eclectique">https://github.com/bitcolorine/Je-suis-eclectique</a>
and the site here: <a href="http://bitcolorine.github.io/Je-suis-eclectique/">http://bitcolorine.github.io/Je-suis-eclectique/</a></p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. I am very determined to build my site and a few others for my projects. 
Thanks.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Hey @bitcolorine! If your site is not updating every time you push, it&#39;s probably because the build is broken. If this is the case, you&#39;ll see emails from GitHub.</p>
<p>Everything in your repo looks fine and seems to build properly for me. :+1: </p>
