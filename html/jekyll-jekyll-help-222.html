            <p>I have a bilingual site. For each post, I like to link to its counterpart. Currently, there is no logical connection between the two posts.</p>
<p>The German posts (default) reside in <code>/_posts</code> while the English posts are located in <code>/en/_posts</code>. The category <code>en</code> which is automatically created by having the posts inside <code>/en</code> is used for permalinks.</p>
<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is there a way I can <em>entangle</em> two posts (German and English) and create the links to the respective counterpart without writing them directly in my posts? What would be the strategy for that?</p>
<p><em>(I let Pages do the build, so plugins won&#39;t work. Also, I don&#39;t want working code, just a small entry point.)</em></p>

          <div class="body"><p>There&#39;s not really any way to do this currently. It&#39;s up to the site creator to determine how they want to handle multilingual sites and how they link their posts together.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>As @mattr- said, there isn&#39;t anything built in, but you could create a loop in your posts layout which looks for the translated counterpart and outputs some HTML if it finds something.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
