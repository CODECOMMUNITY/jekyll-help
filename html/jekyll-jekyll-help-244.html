            <p>This is crazy, I highly doubt it is jekylls fault, but for some reason if I have a page and put
<code>permalink: /videos/</code> in the front matter, the resulting page path is /Videos/ with a capital V. If I do anything else it gives me whatever I put in (lowercase) - vvideos works, /videos/videos/ works, but if it is <code>permalink: /videos/</code> then it is capitalized. This breaks some of my urls as AWS S3 is case sensitive. I have hundreds of other pages, and they all work fine.</p>
<p>I have tested this with a different project, and it does the same thing. So it is not just something to do with the one file/folder, and only if the word is &#39;videos&#39;.</p>
<p>I am on the latest jekyll - 2.5.3 on a PC win 8.1.</p>
<p>Is there some cache somewhere or something that is stuck with Videos that I could clear? This has been happening for a few months, but I stopped working on it for a while and am now back working on it.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>nope, don&#39;t even have a _plugins folder. Also, this is on a Page, not a post just to be clear. I also have checked the config file, and nothing is wrong there. I really think it is some sort of cache problem, though this has been going on for months.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>wow! I got frustrated and decided to make a video of it to link to here so that you don&#39;t think I am crazy... while producing the video I noticed that I had a folder named Videos on the same drive, and thought that was a weird coincidence so I renamed that folder to videos (lowercase) and now it works correctly in Jekyll. Then I looked at my drive and saw another folder capitalized, tried that name in the permalink (lowercase) and it came out capitalized.</p>
<p>I tried a sub folder that was capitalized, and that one worked ok.</p>
<p>So it looks like any top level folder that is on the same drive could cause a problem with permalinks and capitalization.</p>
