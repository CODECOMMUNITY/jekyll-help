            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So far Jekyll has been fun to use and I am starting to get more into it rather than creating basic posts. However, I have made various changes to files such as the main.scss or the index.html in the &quot;_site&quot; folder and find these edited files to display correctly while my server is running, but automatically return to there original state when I restart/regenerate Jekyll. In other words, I completely lose all of my changes. This is very frustrating as I intend to make many UI/functional changes on my site. Has anyone experienced similar problems? I appreciate any advice you can give! </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>When I am developing, I usually run Jekyll in serve &amp; watch mode with <code>jekyll serve -w</code>. This way, I can edit the source files and preview changes immediately (similar to editing the files in <code>_site</code>), while still keeping my changes permanent (i.e. not editing the <code>_site</code> files themselves).</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>@szier1 You should consider the <code>_site</code> folder untouchable. The code in Jekyll specifically removes everything in the <code>_site</code> folder every time it is regenerated. Depending on the platform you are using, there are ways to have your web browser reload once Jekyll is done regenerating the site.</p>
<p>I personally use <a href="https://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> and point it to the <code>_site</code> folder in my project. It watches for changes on those files and automatically refreshes Chrome. Once incremental regeneration is finished, it will work even better.</p>

<p>@alfredxing I don&#39;t remember which version of Jekyll made the change, but the <code>serve</code> command enables auto-regeneration by default.</p>
