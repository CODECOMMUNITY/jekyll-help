            <p>I have a couple collections set up, &#39;case-studies&#39; and &#39;projects&#39;, and I have front matter variables within them for things like client name, project date, project name, etc. I have successfully created loops that display only projects from a specific client, sorted by date, for example, but would I would like to do is create a loop that displays both case studies and projects from a specific client, sorted by date. I&#39;m curious if there is a way to assign more than one collection to a variable to be passed to the loop? Something like the following:</p>
<p>&lt;pre&gt;{% assign client_timeline = site.projects and site.case-studies | where: &#39;client&#39;, page.client | sort: &#39;date&#39; %}

{% for timeline_item in client_timeline %}
{% endfor %}&lt;/pre&gt;

</p>
<p>Everything here has proven successful except for the second collection, which is ignored.</p>
<p>Assigning filtered variables to loops seems like a pretty powerful feature, but I haven&#39;t found a lot of documentation on what all can be done with them. I&#39;ve just started with Jekyll last week so any resources with advanced usage documentation would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I think this (lack of) behavior is being blocked by <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/427">https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/issues/427</a>.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks for your reply. That is disheartening news! I was feeling so close. I see there hasn&#39;t been much action on the topic since August but here&#39;s hoping it gets implemented.</p>
