            <p>What up Hubbsters, So today i tried to get jekyll working on my computer (64 bit- Widows 7 PC) I downloaded ruby, installed it, and got the dev kit (both 64 bit) I ran them both got them both working and made sure to have exacutables. I made sure to give the devkit its own area to play (i.e C:\devkit )
After this i jumped onto my Command prompt and made sure to have C:\devkit in the prompt.<br>Frist I did -
C:\devkit&gt;ruby dk.rb init
that worked completely successful.
Than,
C:\devkit&gt;ruby dk.rb install
that also ran perfect. Here is where the error comes in.
I run,
C:\devkit&gt;gem install jekyll.
It loads for little and than i get this error (I am writing the error verbatim)</p>
<p>ERROR: could not find a valid gem &#39;jekyll&#39; &lt;&gt;=0, here is why:
Unable to download data from <a href="https://rubygems.org/">https://rubygems.org/</a> - ssl_connect return need=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B; certificate verify failed ( <a href="https://api.rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz">https://api.rubygems.org/latest_specs.4.8.gz</a>)</p>
<p>Please help if you can. I have a screen shot of it as well if that would be more useful.</p>
<p>Thanks,
Matthew V</p>

<p>However, I would at first try updating the <code>gem</code> with <code>gem update --system</code>.</p>
