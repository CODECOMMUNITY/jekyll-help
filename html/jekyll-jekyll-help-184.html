            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Jekyll 2.4.0 and Ruby 2.0.09576 installed.</p>
<p>I am working along with Travis from YouTube channel &#39;DevTips&#39; and using all of his files/information to compile his &#39;Artist&#39; project site. Last week I successfully served the project site via Ruby/Jekyll serve from source folder. Today, I tried the same process and the site would not compile. I am using same localhost:8000, that is verified. I am running Win7 64bit and followed advice to run UTF-8 encoding command: chcp 65001.</p>
<p>No files have changed in the portfolio folder on my PC. The other thing on jekyllrb.com/windows/ says is to add a line of code for &#39;Auto-regeneration&#39; to the &#39;Gemfile&#39;...OK, it does not say where this &#39;Gemfile&#39; is to edit...is it here?: C:.../RubyDevKit/bin/gem.windows batch file?</p>
<p>I am stumped as to why the project files compiled and displayed just fine last week and today it does not work, NO connection can be made to localhost:8000...so no site generated. I also tried to view view site via Prepros, using their &#39;Open Live Preview&#39; and that generates a site on localhost:8001 displaying only this text: --- --- {% include header.html %} {% include about.html %} {% include work.html %} {% include clients.html %} {% include contact.html %} {% include form.html %} {% include footer.html %} </p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you!
Mark</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am new to this stuff, have been following Travis, author of YouTube channel &#39;DevTips&#39; and am using his files. To be clear, I successfully served the site on localhost:8000 last week. I&#39;ve also configured the _config.yml file to ensure port used is 8000, but also deleted that and used default port 4000, to no avail.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
