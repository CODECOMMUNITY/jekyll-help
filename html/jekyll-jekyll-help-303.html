<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I am a beginner using jekyll and new to web development, so please be patient with me.</p>
<p>I am coding my portfolio site, with a link to my blog. The fully processed portfolio site sits in _site/index.html which contains a link to the blog (fully processed link exists in _site/blog.html.</p>
<p>Blog.html at the root of the repo has in the front matter a layout of &quot;bl&quot;, which is defined in my layouts folder under &quot;bl.html&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;bl.html&quot; is the layout I want for my blog page, which contains my includes etc.... It also contains the {{ content }} liquid tag.</p>
<p>If I am thinking about this the right way, my posts are being parsed (I think this is the right terminology) into &quot;post.html&quot; - which has the front matter &quot;layout: bl&quot;,  which then parsed into &quot;bl.html&quot;, and that this is so as they both have {{ content }} in each files.</p>
<p>Now all my posts are showing correctly (i think) within &quot;_site/(year)/(month) etc...&quot;. However, they are not ending being parsed through my &quot;blog.html&quot; file, and then visible on my webpage. How I know this is that the fully processed &quot;blog.html&quot; file does not have any of the posts in them.</p>
<p>What will I need to do to solve this issue?</p>
<p>If it helps, I use Prepros for LIveReload, and using LANYON template, <a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">http://lanyon.getpoole.com/</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your time and I really do appreciate the help you can give.</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusing detail.</p>
