            <p>Obviously it&#39;s just HTML + Liquid, so there&#39;s no language to learn, per se, but are there any agencies that have done Jekyll sites in the past?</p>
<p>Alternatively, are there any freelance developers/designers who specialize in Jekyll?</p>

<p>@ndarville Why is this? Ideally, you should be separating content from your display components so that content can be very easily added/changed/deleted without knowing anything about the site&#39;s display components. </p>

<p>I agree with @ndarville though I&#39;ve been working on solutions to help that end of things. So far prose.io is limping along as a stop-gap solution.</p>

I <strong>really really love</strong> it (examples: <a href="http://pixelnest.io">Pixelnest</a>, <a href="http://solarsailer.net">Solar Sailer</a>, <a href="http://dmayance.com">Damien Mayance</a>, <a href="http://indie.stunfest.fr">Stunfest Indie</a> and some more that I can&#39;t show yet). Our goal is to use Jekyll for everything we do if we don&#39;t need a dynamic back-end. Easier to setup and design, less costs and faster rendering/loading. </p>
<p>For a developer, using Jekyll as a blog/site/front-end platform should almost be a no-brainer. I&#39;m not so sure when there are multiple contributors or a non-developer editor. To be honest though, I have not really taken the time to evaluate <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose</a>. That could be a great solution.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>I think Collections work pretty well in the cases where you want users to
edit a non-post document with YAML information. Writing a Prose.io config
in <code>_config.yml</code> goes a long way towards making the the user experience
passable, although discoverability is pretty awful, because the frontmatter
section has an icon-only button.</p>
<p>But considering how many people fall back on crap like Joomla, Drupal
(WordPress, ExpressionEngine), being better than the competition is more
than enough in most cases.</p>
<p>I’m currently helping someone with fixing a Joomla project, and even I have
no idea what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>Having a file uploader in one tab that’s hosted by you and the editor in
another is generally fine, but of course, you can’t have everything in a
GitHub repo, if that’s crucial. It’d probably make my scenario workable.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>It might be worth putting a list up somewhere because I think people are looking for the expertise as the static site paradigm catches on beyond &quot;blogging for hackers.&quot; I&#39;ve gotten Jekyll specific inquiries and clients, even from this thread. @benbalter may be right that it&#39;s merely HTML/CSS, but Jekyll, Liquid and the static site paradigm have their nuances.</p>
<p>At any rate, if anyone&#39;s interested in having it I&#39;d be happy to do the work.</p>
