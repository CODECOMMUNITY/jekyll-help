            <p>Here are my steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>I installed jekyll (gem install jekyll)</li>
<li>I created a new site (jekyll new sitename)</li>
<li>I navigated to that site folder (cd sitename)</li>
<li>I served the site (jekyll serve)</li>
</ol>
<p>I then get this error:  Liquid Exception: Failed to get header. in _posts/2014-11-18-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown</p>
<p>I have not touched the folders in the new site. The post that is causing the problem was not created by me but came with the install. </p>
<p>I am using a Mac OSX 10.8.5; python 3.6.2 and pygments 0.6.0</p>
<p>Any idea what is causing this issue? </p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks for the feedback. I got it to work fine with Python 3 by uninstalling the blog post in the post file that was automatically added during the install. That was what was causing the problem, though I am curious what about it was causing the problem. </p>
<p>When I get some time, I&#39;ll try going down to Python 2.7.6, adding this file back and seeing if it works. I&quot;m curious. </p>
<p>The file was called &quot;2014-11-18-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown. Here&#39;s what was in the file:</p>
<hr>
<p>layout: post
title:  &quot;Welcome to Jekyll!&quot;
date:   2014-11-18 11:08:13</p>
<h2 id="categories-jekyll-update">categories: jekyll update</h2>
<p>You’ll find this post in your <code>_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code>jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>
<p>To add new posts, simply add a file in the <code>_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code>YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>
<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>
<p>{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi(&#39;Tom&#39;)</p>
<h1 id="-prints-hi-tom-to-stdout-">=&gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.</h1>
<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>
