            <p>Hi everyone... </p>
<p>New here, been building sites for a while but I&#39;m not a programmer so never got under the hood more than I needed to.</p>
<p>Wellll... that&#39;s changed and I&#39;m interested. Watching some videos (devtips) got me interested in Jekyll so I could follow along.</p>
<p>Looking into it, there seems to be a &quot;stream&quot; I should be following, that being:
homebrew &gt; rvm &gt; ruby &gt; gems &gt; jekyll</p>
<p>[edit] Oh... and Sass...  </p>
<p>...then onto choosing some code editor if needed. </p>
<p>Is this the way to go?</p>
<p>Do I need to do anything x-code related first?</p>
<p>thanks!
Andrew</p>

          <div class="body"><p>re: xcode
Just make sure it&#39;s installed.  You may encounter gems or packages that you need to compile on your machine and xcode pre-installs GCC and what not for you.</p>
<p>re: homebrew
They are not the only package manager, MacPorts and Fink are good alternatives.  </p>
<p>re: code editor
The latest hotness on the Mac scene is probably Sublime Text.  I&#39;ve been using it for 1.5 years now and I love it.  Once you discover and start building your own snippets you&#39;ll be hooked.</p>

<p>xcode... check. Actually installed that a while back to start learning iOS, as I tend to get into a lot of stuff....
homebrew: thanks for the extra homework!! ; )
code editor: Yeah, saw that (Submlime) - I&#39;ve seen it mentioned in comparisons where everyone seems to like something different. Sure enough, it&#39;s gotta be personal preference drives a lot of the decisions about what to use, just like everything else...</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Thanks Bud! Will take a closer look.. not afraid of terminal! Looks good though.</p>
<p>Also: WTF happened to my last post, formatting wise? I know nothing of markdown, but here&#39;s an experiment...</p>

<p>[edit] Ok, something to do with the greater-than! ... fun.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>that&#39;s a blockquote. There&#39;s tons of how-tos out there on Markdown, though here&#39;s mine: <a href="https://gist.github.com/budparr/9257428">https://gist.github.com/budparr/9257428</a></p>
<p>And there&#39;s special syntax for each &quot;flavor,&quot; like Kramdown, which you can get from their site.</p>
