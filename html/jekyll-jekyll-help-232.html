            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Getting an error when I try to deploy to github pages:</p>
<p>A file was included in <code>_layouts/default.html</code> that is a symlink or does not exist in your <code>_includes</code> directory.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t get around this error after many hours.  The source for my site is on github ( <a href="https://github.com/russt/russt.github.io">https://github.com/russt/russt.github.io</a> ) and the destination is the default ( <a href="http://russt.github.io/">http://russt.github.io/</a> ).  I am just generating the default site using &quot;jekyll new&quot; with a few changes to the _config.yaml file.  I have tried both 2.4.0 and 2.5.2 versions of jekyll</p>
<p>Site looks fine locally, so I assume this has to do with how github is generating the site.</p>
<p>Any clues?  I realize that this could be a github issue, but I want to make sure that I&#39;m not missing something basic.</p>
<p>thanks!
-Russ</p>

          <div class="body"><p>okay, this is a good one - I routinely git ignore &quot;foo&quot; files, but in this case it matched the footer.html pattern.  so indeed the _include file really was missing.</p>
<p>too bad the error message is not more specific about which file is missing!</p>
