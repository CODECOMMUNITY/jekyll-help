            <p>I&#39;ve been playing with collections since they first came out and I built this with it: <a href="http://style.maban.co.uk/">http://style.maban.co.uk/</a> (code here: <a href="https://github.com/maban/styleguide">https://github.com/maban/styleguide</a>) – each item on the page is pulled from a collection which is a series of pure HTML files that don&#39;t contain any front matter, and I generated it like this:</p>
<pre><code>{% for pattern in site.patterns %}
    {{ pattern.content }}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre><p>and in my config file I&#39;ve got</p>
<pre><code>collections:
    patterns:
        output: true
</code></pre><p>It was working great until recently, and I hadn&#39;t touched the code until someone said it wasn&#39;t working for them and I tried it out again locally. Now when I build the site, none of the files in the collection get generated on the page. The only way they&#39;ll display at all is if I insert an empty front matter to each file in the collection.</p>
<p><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/">In the documentation</a> for the content variable of collections, it says &quot;If no YAML Front Matter is provided, this is the entirety of the file contents.&quot;, so it should still work, right?</p>
<p>Has something changed in the codebase that basically says &quot;don&#39;t output this collection file if it&#39;s not got front matter&quot;? Or am I doing something wrong – is there a way to force it to generate it anyway?</p>

          <div class="body"><p>As far as I know, Jekyll will only process a file through it&#39;s generator system if it contains front-matter. I honestly don&#39;t know the history of that behavior, but I feel like it&#39;s been like that since Collections was introduced. Obviously there could be nuiances that I&#39;m not aware of, but the idea is generally: &quot;Add front-matter to files that you want Jekyll to process.&quot;</p>

          <div class="body"><p>It did used to work. If that&#39;s how it is now, would it be worth changing the wording of the documentation? This had me thinking it would process a file without front-matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a corresponding folder (e.g. &lt;source&gt;/_my_collection) and add documents. YAML Front Matter is read in as data if it exists, if not, then everything is just stuck in the Document’s content attribute.

          <div class="body"><p>Looks great @maban, I&#39;ll certainly keep an eye on that. I&#39;m really interested in how Jekyll can be used in new ways, like cutting production time of the less glamorous, but essential, parts of the web design process; and I think style guides are a really important part of that.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been dabbling with using Jekyll to replace traditional web design tools in rapidly creating things like element collages, style tiles, and type samples in addition to just wireframing: <a href="https://github.com/nternetinspired/jekyll-design">https://github.com/nternetinspired/jekyll-design</a> </p>
<p>A fully fleshed out pattern library is next on my hit list… </p>

<p>I really need to give it some more time and refine things a bit further because I&#39;m happy with how it works as a POC. I&#39;ll be keeping an eye on Barebones for inspiration ;) </p>
