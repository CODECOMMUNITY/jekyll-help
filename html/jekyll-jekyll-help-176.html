            <p>Consider the requirement for a document site with one more more sections that have common topics. Each section has its own TOC and can navigate to the next/prev items in that TOC using prev-&gt;next buttons. The documents may have slightly different rendering in each section (and of course a different TOC/next/prev). There should be a single &quot;content&quot; document for the common content.</p>
<p>The obvious way to implement something like this is to have the &quot;common content&quot; source as an <em>_include</em>. Then have &quot;stub&quot; articles for each TOC item that imports it. This would work nicely and allow me to feed in &quot;version specific&quot; configuration in the front matter.</p>
<p>Are there any other ways that people have achieved this? For example, is there a way to automatically copy appropriate documents into specified locations at build time (from within Jekyll)?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Hi Troy,</p>
<p>Collections might be part of the solution to my problem, but not the whole problem.</p>
<p>Consider the imaginary case where I have a site supporting a number of manuals for using and assembling bicycles. Each section of the site has its own table of contents (and I might reasonably have these in collections). While some articles will be different for each bike, a few will be common (for example &quot;How to ring the bell&quot;).</p>
<p>My question was &quot;what is the BEST&quot; method for maintaining this common content so it renders in all places where it is used. I THINK that we need a separate stub for each instance of the article that includes a common document that we don&#39;t render. The include markup allows this, but only for files in _include (which I guess is OK). 
 Is there any alternative? E.g. can we somehow declare in the file where it should build to as a first step. </p>
<p>Hope that makes it clear!</p>
