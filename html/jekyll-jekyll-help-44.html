          <div class="body">
            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>so far I was able to set up jekyll on github pages: <a href="http://magnusmetz.github.io/">http://magnusmetz.github.io/</a></p>
<p>I want to use it as a substitute for RPubs and publish posts written as *.Rmd files.</p>
<p>It seems, there are two major issues left, which were impossible for me to solve so far and I was not able to solve the problem with the information I found on the internet.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I use RStudio to version control the website. If I make a change in one of the markdown files in the _posts folder and commit these changes, the changes are not overtaken on <a href="http://magnusmetz.github.io/">http://magnusmetz.github.io/</a>, although I can see them on <a href="http://localhost:4000/">http://localhost:4000/</a>. Why is that? It seems that changes in the markdown files are tracked but the subsequent changes in _site are not transmitted to github. How to solve this issue?</p>
</li>
<li><p>I want to use *.Rmd files as the root files for my posts instead of markdown. How can I accomplish that? I know the blog of <a href="http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/">http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/</a> but I was not really able to accomplish that. But this is a pretty good example what I want to do.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks in advance for further help.</p>
<p>Magnus</p>

          <div class="body"><p>Regarding your <code>#1</code> above RStudio is likely only tracking files for you locally.  You would need to then push your repo changes to Github so that they display on the website.  I can&#39;t comment to your <code>#2</code>. :smiley:</p>

          <div class="body"><p>LOL.  I didn&#39;t even know you can push changes to Github with RStudio.  Just started working with it.  You might want to take your <code>#1</code> then to RStudio on Github and post the issue there.  Especially if Jekyll is building locally and you can see it locally.  If I have any free time this week, I&#39;ll probably trying messing with RStudio and pushing to Github.  Would be ideal with working some of my R projects. :thought_balloon: Thanks for the idea.</p>

          <div class="body"><p>No problem. It&#39;s usually working perfectly. This is the first time I have a problem like this. The strange thing is, it doesn&#39;t seem that RStudio is the problem. Also if I use following commands the changes in _site are not on Github:</p>
<pre><code>git add -A
git commit -m &quot;Commit message&quot;
git push

          <div class="body"><p>Yea so the <strong>local view</strong> with <code>Jekyll -serve</code> just serves up your <code>_site</code> folder to your local machine.  You can upload everything in that folder to a webhost and your site would look exactly the same as it does locally.  With Github Pages, you are providing Github the pre-build files and allowing Github to build and serve it for you.  Is RStudio updating posts in <code>magnusmetz.github.com/_posts/</code> or <code>magnusmetz.github.com/_site/_posts/</code>?</p>
