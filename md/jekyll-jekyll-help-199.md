I&#x27;ve seen it in many markdown files. They all seem to contain code inside. What does it mean? I know, it&#x27;s a very noobish question.

It&#x27;s Liquid markup (more documentation [here](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics)). It basically allows for logic, tags, and filters within a Markdown (or Textile or HTML) file.
