# [Having issues running &#x27;gem install jekyll&#x27;](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/28)

I have all the requirements to run this command, however this keeps popping up.

ubuntu:~$ gem install jekyll
ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don&#x27;t have write permissions into the /var/lib/gems/1.8 directory.

Do I run &#x27;sudo gem install jekyll&#x27; or will I screw something up doing that?

If you&#x27;re using the system default ruby (which is looks like in your case)
then using &#x60;sudo gem install&#x60; is fine.

It seems that conversation moved to #29, I will close this issue to keep the conversation in one thread. BTW if you were using ruby 1.8, Jekyll 1.5.1+ will not work, updating ruby is recommended. Check [issue #8](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/8).
