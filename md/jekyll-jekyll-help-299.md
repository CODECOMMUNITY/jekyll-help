# [An image wrapped inside div does not display](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/pull/299)

An image wrapped inside a div does not show up in the html file created. The element #my_photo is styled as follows: 

#my_photo
{
  float: right;
  padding-left: 50px;
}

This is not a Jekyll issue. When you use Markdown or HTML correctly to show an image and have no CSS applied that will hide the image, the image will show up. Jekyll doesn&#x27;t interfere with that.

Also I don&#x27;t understand what this pull request is doing here.

Depending on the markdown renderer and options, sometimes markdown is not rendered within html blocks.

Does the markdown display versus the image?

Try separating the html and markdown with a newline/whitespace.

Also try without the html block.

Hey, first off, this must have been an issue, I realised it only after I posted here. So, sorry! 

@jaybe-jekyll Yes, the markdown code shows up instead of the image.

Then it might be the issue. Consider sometthing like this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&lt;p&gt;Nice, but _sneaky_ paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

This will render a paragraph, but the &#x60;sneaky&#x60; won&#x27;t be put inside &#x60;em&#x60; tags, but as is (i.e. &#x60;_sneaky_ &#x60;, not &#x60;&lt;em&gt;sneaky&lt;/em&gt;&#x60;). The problem is you can&#x27;t mix HTML and Markdown in the same line.

This will work:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;md
Nice, but  _not so sneaky_ paragraph.
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

â€¦ which is the same as this:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&lt;p&gt;Nice, but  &lt;em&gt;not so sneaky&lt;/em&gt; paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

If this doesn&#x27;t help you, it&#x27;d really help to have an example file with Markdown that is not processed correctly.
