# [Jekyll Job Board?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/86)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Continuing the epic discussion found in #60, let&#x27;s talk about &quot;Jekyll devs&quot; and the possibility of putting together a list of some kind that lets y&#x27;all demonstrate their h4x0r skillz, and potentially get hired to build a site for someone else.

I&#x27;ll start: We could build *(gasp)* a Jekyll site that showcases the folks who are down to help other folks for cash money prizes. Include some personal/business info, some example sites, and a list of expertise (e.g.: design chops, brand stuff, content strategy, etc.).

Thoughts?

I&#x27;d be happy to help with any UI stuff needed, I&#x27;m sure I could round up a pair of headphones from Sound Earphones

I don&#x27;t think Jekyll should be affiliated with promoting certain developers, but an unofficial Jekyll job board is something I could get behind. It would also be a great resource for beta testers for me, as they&#x27;d all be (presumably) pro users.

I started working on a job board platform (in Django) this spring that&#x27;s ready to roll if folks want to embrace it. I turned on a Jekyll board for demo&#x27;s sake:

I think the main goal would be to create a pro community, kind of like how [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) does with graphic design. Granted, Dribbble is tool-agnostic and it&#x27;s for design generalists, whereas this would be specific to Jekyll.

Maybe instead of creating the site primarily for recruiting, it could be primarily for showcasing projects that are done in Jekyll. This lets recruiting happen naturally based on people&#x27;s interest in the projects that are submitted.

I grabbed thejekyllblog.com a while ago with the intent of regularly
highlighting some interesting uses of Jekyll, common Jekyll questions on
Stack Overflow &lt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jekyll&gt;, and
service providers with Jekyll/Liquid/etc experience.

Source is on GitHub: https://github.com/ainc/thejekyllblog and site is
(naturally) hosted via GitHub Pages. I&#x27;ve gotten bogged down in a few other
projects and haven&#x27;t touched this in a few months, but now may be a good
opportunity to revive it. It&#x27;s still running the old stock template, and
most of the content pages are just stubs, but it&#x27;s a starting point. If
more folks would like to contribute, I&#x27;m glad to add push access or break
this into its own Org if that&#x27;s a better fit!

Anyone want to start by writing a blog post to highlight a Jekyll project
that you&#x27;ve done?

Gonna close this since it didn&#x27;t really gain any traction.

@troyswanson What about a page on the Jekyll-Help Github wiki? 

Or a JEKYLL_DEVS.md that you accept pull requests against? 

Thinking KISS.

I think that&#x27;s the best idea, but as @parkr said:

&gt; I don&#x27;t think Jekyll should be affiliated with promoting certain developers

So, that might not fly. I&#x27;d love to do that, though.

I&#x27;m not pushing the idea in general, but -- if people are looking / asking for pointers to developers -- then it&#x27;s silly not to have a list somewhere. 

The benefit of the wiki is that people can add themselves and it&#x27;s not &quot;endorsed&quot; by Jekyll, e.g., https://github.com/bricoleurs/bricolage/wiki/a-list-of-bricolage-sites-and-sightings

Two cents.

While we can&#x27;t support anything outright, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t do it. :smile:

Maybe in the the [&quot;sites&quot;](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites) page of the wiki people can flag if they&#x27;re for hire next to their sites there, or perhaps sites that are by people accepting work can be segregated on the list. Lofi for a showcase and that list is probably too long to be of much use, but maybe a starting point.
