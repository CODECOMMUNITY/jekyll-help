# [How to install a theme?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/142)

> state: **open** opened by: **** on: ****

I have the pages being generated using this tutorial:

https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages

But when I navigate to the pages, they are plain html. I see plenty of themes on the Internet but no instructions on the Jekyll site for installing themes?

If I use the page generator on github I can pick a theme for a single page but how to install a theme that works both locally and remotely. Thanks.
