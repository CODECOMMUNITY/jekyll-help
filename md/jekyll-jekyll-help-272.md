Hi there,

I have run into problems installing Homebrew. The original thread was here:
https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/3447#issuecomment-74112554

My error in Terminal is below. I don&#x27;t know how to fix the Macports problem &amp; the pkg-config issue.

Please can someone advise me?

Kind Regards
