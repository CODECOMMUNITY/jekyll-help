# [Linkedin icon for footer](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/172)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

I am formatting the footer to my blog and would like to include an icon next to my linkedin link (similar to the icons for twitter and github links which come in the default jekyll profile). Does any one happen to have the html fill pattern for linkedin?  (something like &#x60;&lt;path fill=&quot;#828282&quot; d=&quot;...&quot;/&gt;&#x60;  in &#x60;footer.html&#x60;), but one that generates the linkedin logo?

Thanks!

What you&#x27;re loving for is a __SVG icon for LinkedIn__. I&#x27;m sure you can find on on the interwebz and use it there.
