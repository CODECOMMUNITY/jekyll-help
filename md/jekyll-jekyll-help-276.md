# [Solo theme won&#x27;t build in user pages? ](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/276)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Hi, I&#x27;m trying to setup a user pages for my brother based on the jekyll theme Solo (http://solo.chibi.io). I had set it up so he can edit the index.md file via prose.io whenever he likes, however gh-user pages doesn&#x27;t seem to be building changes to the index.md file! Prose edits the file, but it doesn&#x27;t build to _site. Strangely it seems to work fine on my local jekyll server, so I&#x27;m not sure what I can do to make it build. 

repo is at https://github.com/SeanZimmer/seanzimmer.github.io

Any ideas for edits to the config file or structure that could fix this? (I know he could just build via command line, but that&#x27;s a bit technical for him.) Thank you!

Just to be sure, the branch you have the site on is called __gh-pages__ (not gh-user), right?

Yeah, it&#x27;s on master branch at his github account under seanzimmer.github.io, since my understanding is you don&#x27;t make a gh-pages branch for user pages.
