A &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;Powered by Jekyll&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; image/button we could proudly display on our websites.  I&#x27;m no designer, so yea.  Something with a nice hover change too. :smiley:

Do you have an example of something you&#x27;d like it to look like? I&#x27;m personally opposed to the idea - I prefer text links since they are more accessible and don&#x27;t take extra time to load.

Image + alt is just as accessible as text. As for load time, minimal at
best for anyone who actually cares about their website.

As to examples, here&#x27;s a set of them from the Drupal world. Personally I
like the medium sized buttons if I were to use anything.

It&#x27;s all good.  I&#x27;ll be using a text link regardless. :smiley:

@iamgabeortiz Feel free to use [Jekyll’s logo](https://github.com/jekyll/logo) on your site.
