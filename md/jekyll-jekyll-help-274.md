# [Generate pages from a property of _data/file.yml?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/274)

I have a _date/file.yml with 200+ entries and all of them have a &#x27;tag&#x27; property. Is it possible to create a page for every value of the &#x27;categorie&#x27; property without know what they are? 

There are around 10 different tags, so I could just create 10 pages and loop through them accordingly, but it seems smarter to automate the process.

Is this possible to do without the use of a plugin, so I can keep hosting it on gh-pages?
