# [Filtre category in pagination](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/161)

> state: **open** opened by: **** on: ****

Hi community !

I&#x27;ve add a pagination on my blog part, displaying all categories except &quot;portfolio&quot;. There are not posters but still create a &quot;post invisible&quot; when I post in the &quot;portfolio&quot;.

If you want clone my projet : https://github.com/LeG3nDz/v3.stephane-richin.lan

Could you tell me/help me what I did wrong ?

Thank you so much !
