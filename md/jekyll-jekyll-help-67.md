&#x60;redcarpet&#x60; is installed and in the path.

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
$ redcarpet --version
Redcarpet 3.1.2

$ ruby --version
ruby 2.1.2p95 (2014-05-08 revision 45877) [i686-linux]

$ jekyll --version
jekyll 2.0.3
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
But when I try to build the site, I get:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
$ jekyll build --trace

Are you using a Ruby version manager?

No. I am not. Anyway. I tried creating a new fresh site, and it worked. I saw that the new &#x60;_config.yml&#x60; had some more stuff than the old one. I added &#x60;_markdown: kramdown&#x60; to the config file on the &quot;old&quot; site and it worked.

There&#x27;s also a bug presently where if you are using the rouge interpreter but the gem isn&#x27;t installed, Jekyll will tell you it&#x27;s because Redcarpet isn&#x27;t installed, when it&#x27;s actually just that rouge isn&#x27;t installed.

Yeah, installing rouge solved. Thanks.
