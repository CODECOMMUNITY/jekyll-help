On my blog when I search for a particular string it wont return any result.
second I want to implement sub string search for example : Blog Post are : &quot;Naushad is Here&quot;
and in navigation bar I am searching for a content like : &quot;shad&quot; 
it should return a result because &quot;shad&quot; is present in &quot;Naushad&quot; 

so can anyone help me how to implement this functionality on my blog. which plugin I should use and how to migrate this feature.

Hey @nausn97!

I have a simple search script I wrote for my own blog! You can see the script here and I&#x27;ve pointed you to the relevant line: https://github.com/winghouchan/winghouchan.github.io/blob/master/js/scripts.js#L102

Need any help understanding it, post a comment and I&#x27;ll be sure to reply.
