# [FAQ](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/195)

Despite asking folks to search before posting, it seems like we get a lot of dupes. Maybe we can set up a list of FAQs in the README? What do y&#x27;all reckon?

Yes, @troyswanson you read my mind.. I was going to post the same question today :+1:. Maybe we can add an entry to the README and add wiki references? or we can add the FAQs directly into the README.

I feel like we should do some analysis on some of the most frequently asked questions here and make some improvements to the documentation at jekyllrb.com. I think it would be more ideal to point folks to official documentation that solves the problem as opposed to a wiki article in this here repo. :thought_balloon:

well, we can definitively try to improve the documentation, but remember that some of the problems people are having are related to their development environment and for those cases I believe we shouldn&#x27;t bloat the documentation and leave this to a FAQ in this repo.

@albertogg :+1: Improve docs where it makes sense, provide other resources otherwise.

I&#x27;ll do some digging in this repo to find the most common dupes and post them back here. Feel free to do the same if you&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m a busy guy. :wink:
