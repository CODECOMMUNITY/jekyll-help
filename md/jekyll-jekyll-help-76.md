# [Mavericks, homebrew, rvm, ruby, gems, jekyll... Like that?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/76)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Hi everyone... 

New here, been building sites for a while but I&#x27;m not a programmer so never got under the hood more than I needed to.

Wellll... that&#x27;s changed and I&#x27;m interested. Watching some videos (devtips) got me interested in Jekyll so I could follow along.

Looking into it, there seems to be a &quot;stream&quot; I should be following, that being:
homebrew &gt; rvm &gt; ruby &gt; gems &gt; jekyll

[edit] Oh... and Sass...  

...then onto choosing some code editor if needed. 

Is this the way to go?

Do I need to do anything x-code related first?

thanks!
Andrew

re: xcode
Just make sure it&#x27;s installed.  You may encounter gems or packages that you need to compile on your machine and xcode pre-installs GCC and what not for you.

re: homebrew
They are not the only package manager, MacPorts and Fink are good alternatives.  

re: code editor
The latest hotness on the Mac scene is probably Sublime Text.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 1.5 years now and I love it.  Once you discover and start building your own snippets you&#x27;ll be hooked.

Thanks Joe!
&gt; xcode... check. Actually installed that a while back to start learning iOS, as I tend to get into a lot of stuff....
&gt; homebrew: thanks for the extra homework!! ; )
&gt; code editor: Yeah, saw that (Submlime) - I&#x27;ve seen it mentioned in comparisons where everyone seems to like something different. Sure enough, it&#x27;s gotta be personal preference drives a lot of the decisions about what to use, just like everything else...

cheers

@I-andrew-I - if you&#x27;re new to this stuff, you might like https://www.cakebrew.com/ - as a gui frontend to Homebrew

Thanks Bud! Will take a closer look.. not afraid of terminal! Looks good though.

Also: WTF happened to my last post, formatting wise? I know nothing of markdown, but here&#x27;s an experiment...

&gt; This line starts with a greater-than.
cheers
Andrew

[edit] Ok, something to do with the greater-than! ... fun.

that&#x27;s a blockquote. There&#x27;s tons of how-tos out there on Markdown, though here&#x27;s mine: https://gist.github.com/budparr/9257428

And there&#x27;s special syntax for each &quot;flavor,&quot; like Kramdown, which you can get from their site.
