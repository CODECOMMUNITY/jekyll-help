# [Rename repository to eg. jekyll-help](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/17)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

People who are watching via emails get a tag in the subject line of &#x60;[help]&#x60; where the repository name is. This isn&#x27;t terribly helpful, renaming the repo while it&#x27;s still in it&#x27;s infancy could help people out a lot long-term.

Ahh, good observation. Guess that forces our hand?

Do you think many people are subscribed to more than one help repo? I really like the cleanliness of the URL. @benbalter is there a way to change this on the user&#x27;s end, like get NWO (e.g. &#x60;[jekyll/help]&#x60;) in the subject line?

@parkr You&#x27;re probably right in that there&#x27;s not many other */help repos, however you&#x27;ve also advocated people forking the repo to share code. If I were to fork jekyll/help I would create mscharley/help by default. Somewhat less desirable and far less useful.

Coming from GitHub, a simple [help] doesn&#x27;t really provide enough context. I agree that it&#x27;s clean, but we shouldn&#x27;t expect users to modify settings in order for them to know that it&#x27;s Jekyll they&#x27;re getting help with.

Ideally, we want people to see how well Jekyll Help works and do the same with their projects, so in a perfect world, we’d have a “namespacing” issue, as Jekyll Help shoots to stardom. :)

I do love the cleanliness of the URL. I don&#x27;t feel like filtering on a subject of &#x27;[help]&#x27; when GitHub provides proper List-Id headers for it&#x27;s emails is a valid reason to change the repo. That said, plenty of us don&#x27;t filter our email at all, so I&#x27;d be fine with a repo rename to &#x60;jekyll-help&#x60;.

&gt;  @benbalter is there a way to change this on the user&#x27;s end, like get NWO (e.g. [jekyll/help]) in the subject line?

I would love to see it. I wonder since day one here why Github doesn’t put user’s name in the subject line.

User names are in the From header, not really any need to put it in the
subject line as well.

@mscharley, I mean the user name from the *repository owner*. It’s &quot;jekyll&quot; here. Github could add it as namespace:

Re: [jekyll/help] Rename repository to eg. jekyll-help (#17)
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;

But now I see, the To-field is already namespaced: &#x60;jekyll/help &lt;help@noreply.github.com&gt;&#x60;. So you can already identify the sender.

Except that email apps rarely show the to field in listings, it was clearly
to *me*, it&#x27;s in my inbox.

What do we want to do here? I vote for changing it. Either way, we should decide something. :smile:

It makes me sad to see the redundancy, but it&#x27;s done. Hopefully this clears up your inboxes!

@parkr I agree, dude. It&#x27;s better now, though. Thanks.
