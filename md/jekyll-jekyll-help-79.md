# [Pagination by date](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/79)

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone has successfully paginated posts by date? Specifically, I&#x27;d like to paginated my posts by year. 

Any plugins out there that can do this?

After having thought about it, I think I can do this manually.
