# [Add a minimal test configuration](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/pull/102)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

This adds a minimal Travis test configuration for a Jekyll installation. We should encourage people to provide a minimal example for their questions as a pull request. If the tests pass, people can help each other much faster.

If collaborators like the idea, maybe one can do the rest.

* [ ] Add a short description, how to provide an example as pull request
* [ ] Add the repo on Travis
* [ ] Add a badge to readme

Gah, GitHub double posted my original comment, so I deleted one, and it deleted them both!

Anyways, the gist of my response is that I&#x27;m not sure the benefits of this new way of asking for help would outweigh the learning curve required to do it properly. People are coming here because they need help, and I imagine people will need help asking for help with this workflow. The goal should be to shorten the amount of time between when the person has the problem to when they have that problem solved. There are a lot of waypoints in between, but believe this will ultimately result in longer resolution times.

I&#x27;d love to hear other takes, though.

@troyswanson I propose pull requests as an *alternative*. A “confused and frustrated person” would ask the old way. An experienced developer new to Jekyll could create a pull request, to show what’s not working for her.

@troyswanson The readme does already encourage people to create pull requests in the first place:

&gt; 1. Have some code that isn&#x27;t working? Fork this repo, add your code to a feature branch, push up and create a pull request. Anyone who sees your PR can comment on your code: &quot;Hey, you forgot a curly bracket here!&quot;

It’s written by @parkr in https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/commit/e3fb33926e4f07a21c3194bbda5c0750a5cf052b.

Ya, that&#x27;s a good point, although no one has ever done it that way. That said, I&#x27;m :+1: for this addition if we&#x27;re going to continue to encourage folks to do this.

Whatever @jekyll/help wants – if this is going to be very useful in answering questions, then take it! If not, then I&#x27;d rather keep the repo clean. But whatever you guys need, go for it.
