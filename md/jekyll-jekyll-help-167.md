# [Problem installing jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/167)

On my macbook air OSX, 10.9.4, I ran
sudo gem install jekyll
and got the following:

Successfully installed kramdown-1.4.2

I followed your advice and ran successfully: 
sudo gem update --system
but this did not affect the error. The second time it gave the same error:

Fetching: fast-stemmer-1.0.2.gem (100%)

Can you help??

It seems like you have to install the Xcode Command Line Tools first (run &#x60;xcode-select --install&#x60; in your terminal).

Hope that helps!

Also running &#x60;gem install jekyll&#x60; with sudo should not be necessary and may lead to problems later on.

Thanks. I believe it installed fully this time. 

But if I don&#x27;t do it as superuser, I have to change permissions on dozens of folders one at a time (at least, I&#x27;m not sure of the command to do it wholesale on a tree of subfolders so was doing it with command-I, then unlocking each folder). I&#x27;m not sure what problems this may lead to. I&#x27;m working on my own macbook air and am my own admin so I&#x27;m hoping there are no security issues.
