Hi, I would like to add a link to the posts layout, so that it will contain a link to the markup page link of the post hosted on github.

This provides easy access for editing. How can this be done? I checked page.date and page.title but coucln&#x27;t parse them in a way that mimics the github url schema.

Also is it possible to use ruby&#x27;s #{} in jekyll?
