# [Gist Inclusion](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/32)

Is it me or did something change?

This doesn&#x27;t work &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;{% gist 8d38d89e7cba8dbaad61 %}&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [@example](http://gabeortiz.com/posts/jekyll-gist-issue-test)

But this does &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;{% gist iamgabeortiz/8d38d89e7cba8dbaad61 %}&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; [@example](http://gabeortiz.com/posts/open-external-links-new-tab-via-jquery)

Eventhough all my gists are Public.  According to [Jekyll Templates](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/) that should not be the case.  Of course I could be a newb. :stuck_out_tongue:

Looks like that script isn&#x27;t legit anymore. Looking into it...

Hmm. I don&#x27;t know much about the gist feature, but you&#x27;re right, you have to include your username in the string. I&#x27;ll make a quick pull request to update the docs. Thanks for the report!

And just like that, docs have been updated! That&#x27;s how we roll here. :rabbit:
