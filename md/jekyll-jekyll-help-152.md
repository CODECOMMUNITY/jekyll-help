# [jekyll command documented for developers?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/152)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Hello,

I&#x27;m a new user of Jekyll (I&#x27;ve launched just a few websites) and I&#x27;m not a pro ruby developer yet (I&#x27;m still learning the basics); well to the point: is there any information where I can read how to add &quot;subcommands/options&quot; to jekyll?

I made a few improvements via bash scripts, but I wanna integrate them &quot;via jekyll [subcommand]&quot; in order to create a pull request and contribute.

Thanks for your help.


Regards!

Hello @TonnyORG, I can recommend you to take a look at [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) It&#x27;s a gem but it&#x27;s a great and &quot;easy&quot; way to get started adding subcommands. Hope this is what you wanted!
