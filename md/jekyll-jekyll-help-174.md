Hello,

I&#x27;m trying to install Jekyll and every time I try the &quot;$ gem install jekyll&quot; on Terminal, I encounter this message:
&quot;ERROR:  While executing gem ... (Gem::FilePermissionError)
    You don&#x27;t have write permissions for the /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0 directory.&quot;

I downloaded Xcode but am not sure what the directions mean to install the &quot;Command-Line Tools it ships with. Download in  Preferences → Downloads → Components.&quot;. Can you direct me to where I can find the command-line tools?

Thank you!

You need to open Xcode and open Preferences, Downloads, Components. There you can download the Command-Line Tools.
