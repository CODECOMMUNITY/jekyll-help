# [Are there any web development shops with experience building Jekyll sites? ](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/60)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Obviously it&#x27;s just HTML + Liquid, so there&#x27;s no language to learn, per se, but are there any agencies that have done Jekyll sites in the past?

Alternatively, are there any freelance developers/designers who specialize in Jekyll?

I’ve done Jekyll a few times. It’s perfect when it’s perfect, but the moment the client needs any control with things like

- translations
- updating the site (regularly: blogging; vs. irregularly: such as contact information)

things get kinda hairy.

Jekyll is immensely fast, when you’re the only one who needs editing rights, but falls short, whenever that is not the case.

I know http://developmentseed.org/ has been building some great stuff, and built/open-sourced Prose.io for allowing clients to manage their jekyll sites.

We have built our own site in Jekyll http://flipside.org and are currently working on: https://github.com/flipside-org/penny-harvest

We love it and use it whenever it&#x27;s a good fit for the client / project.

&gt; Jekyll is immensely fast, when you’re the only one who needs editing rights, but falls short, whenever that is not the case.

@ndarville Why is this? Ideally, you should be separating content from your display components so that content can be very easily added/changed/deleted without knowing anything about the site&#x27;s display components.

Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d say I &quot;specialize&quot; in Jekyll, but I&#x27;ve built [my own site](http://redhotvengeance.com) with it, and have used it for the last couple of years (as it has evolved). I currently work as a contract/consulting developer, and I have recommended Jekyll when the right type of project comes along.

@parkr What interface do you provide the clients for editing their site contents?

@ndarville Jekyll doesn&#x27;t provide it, but SublimeText (or similar) and a quick &quot;here are the files you will work with&quot; worked for me and my colleagues at Cornell&#x27;s CALS Communications. For quick edits on reps hosted on GitHub, we use Prose, otherwise GitHub for *PLATFORM* &amp; a text editor should be fine! They write markdown, commit when they&#x27;re done with a change and push up.

@parkr What do you do for image uploads/changes?

@ndarville We have used the image tag plugin to process images and ensure specific sizes and ratios. A user uploads and image to a folder and the images are generated on build. Downside is that you won&#x27;t be able to host the site on gh pages.

I strung a Jekyll site together over Christmas. There&#x27;s talk of possible deployment on behalf of certain clients. If it fits circumstances we&#x27;d do it.

At [Clearbold](http://clearbold.com), we&#x27;re using it for all static site builds and to facilitate front-end templates destined to be wired up in other platforms. We&#x27;ve fully embraced Jekyll.

I&#x27;ve designed and built 8 sites in Jekyll so far and currently building several more, including a series of 2-3 sites for the American Bar Association and one in beta for the Dutch government. Most all for clients (non-technical content creators). I&#x27;m most definitely specializing in static sites with a preference for Jekyll. 

My firm is just me though I may be looking to partner/expand. 

I agree with @ndarville though I&#x27;ve been working on solutions to help that end of things. So far prose.io is limping along as a stop-gap solution.

Here&#x27;s a sampling:
https://github.com/iliadx/iliadx (for the Dutch government beta) http://iliadx.us
 Three of the current sites I&#x27;m working on are fairly complex, but they&#x27;re not ready to be shown. Some smaller ones:
https://github.com/sonnetmedia/linnullmann http://linnullmann.net (this one is bi-lingual, though wouldn&#x27;t go far as saying it&#x27;s a model of how to do a bi-lingual site)
https://github.com/chrisabani/chrisabani.github.io http://chrisabani.com/

I&#x27;ve done like 6 sites on it and I really love it. I&#x27;ve also helped some friends move from WordPress to Jekyll + GitHub Pages. I think Prose.io really help non-technical people to deliver content to a Jekyll site and GitHub abilities to edit and render content online are lovely.

Recently, like 2 weeks ago, I migrated the [ruby.org.ve](http://ruby.org.ve/) (the Venezuelan Ruby users group site) from Tumblr to Jekyll + GitHub Page using the [poole/layon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. Also, I&#x27;ve been running my personal site in Jekyll for more than two years and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.

Used it for a few years. Contributed feature suggestions that have made it into Jekyll.

I&#x27;ve developed a lot of websites with Jekyll for my company during the last year. I **really really love** it (examples: [Pixelnest](http://pixelnest.io), [Solar Sailer](http://solarsailer.net), [Damien Mayance](http://dmayance.com), [Stunfest Indie](http://indie.stunfest.fr) and some more that I can&#x27;t show yet). Our goal is to use Jekyll for everything we do if we don&#x27;t need a dynamic back-end. Easier to setup and design, less costs and faster rendering/loading. 

For a developer, using Jekyll as a blog/site/front-end platform should almost be a no-brainer. I&#x27;m not so sure when there are multiple contributors or a non-developer editor. To be honest though, I have not really taken the time to evaluate [Prose](http://prose.io/). That could be a great solution.

Most of my freelance work involves handing off front-end templates and CSS/JS to clients, so I&#x27;ll do the work in Jekyll which makes my life way easier. Sass, templates, partials, etc. Client can either use those or the generated files. Works pretty well.

Depending on our company&#x27;s requirements, Jekyll is usually my goto for most sites we develop. The ones that don&#x27;t use Jekyll usually are Wordpress/Joomla requirements.

We recently migrated the [Awesome Inc](http://www.awesomeinc.org) and [Awesome Inc U](http://www.awesomeincu.com) sites over to Jekyll. One lives on GitHub Pages, the other DreamHost (it uses a few plugins). We have also done on-site training sessions in Jekyll for companies, and have an [online course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/jekyll-and-github-pages/).

I’m actually very close to making Jekyll work as a CMS alternative to WordPress and Drupal, but unfortunately, making image uploads work within Prose is the main hold-out. And making sys admins support a Ruby-based/AWS solution with GitHub hooks takes some nudging, too.

Currently, I’m thinking about a separate image-upload service that returns URLs that people enter in their Collection YAML:

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;yaml
# ...
- images
    - /media/1.png
    - /media/2.png
    - /media/3.png

@ndarville I&#x27;ve been struggling with the &quot;image&quot; problem for non-technical folks adopting Jekyll as well.  I&#x27;m toying with the idea of producing an app that will generate a YAML formatted list of images given a link from an Imgur or Flickr gallery.

seems like at least a few people are trying to attack the client-friendly &quot;post-cms&quot; cms, including myself. We should have a place to confer.

I think Collections work pretty well in the cases where you want users to
edit a non-post document with YAML information. Writing a Prose.io config
in &#x60;_config.yml&#x60; goes a long way towards making the the user experience
passable, although discoverability is pretty awful, because the frontmatter
section has an icon-only button.

But considering how many people fall back on crap like Joomla, Drupal
(WordPress, ExpressionEngine), being better than the competition is more
than enough in most cases.

I’m currently helping someone with fixing a Joomla project, and even I have
no idea what the hell is going on.

Having a file uploader in one tab that’s hosted by you and the editor in
another is generally fine, but of course, you can’t have everything in a
GitHub repo, if that’s crucial. It’d probably make my scenario workable.

Y&#x27;all, I&#x27;m going to close this issue since it&#x27;s kind of gone into the weeds.

Feel free to open new issues to discuss particular topics; &quot;Using collections to manage media files&quot;, &quot;Comment/critique my new Jekyll site&quot;, etc. I love seeing these discussions, so keep them coming!

It might be worth putting a list up somewhere because I think people are looking for the expertise as the static site paradigm catches on beyond &quot;blogging for hackers.&quot; I&#x27;ve gotten Jekyll specific inquiries and clients, even from this thread. @benbalter may be right that it&#x27;s merely HTML/CSS, but Jekyll, Liquid and the static site paradigm have their nuances.

At any rate, if anyone&#x27;s interested in having it I&#x27;d be happy to do the work.
