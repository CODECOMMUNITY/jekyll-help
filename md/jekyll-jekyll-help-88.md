# [Local Jekyll site works, github pages site does not display.](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/88)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

I am learning how to build a site with Jekyll. I&#x27;m confident that my set up is correct because it had been working well, I&#x27;ve been building and pushing changes without any trouble until I added a list of posts to my template.
Then all I see are my pages and even if I edit my pages no changes get reflected on my site after I push my commits.

I encountered this problem at the begining and I deleted my feed.xml file and suddenly everything worked, but the feed.xml is necessary if I have a blog so it&#x27;s back.

Could this be what is causing my problem?
I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s code related. You can view my repository here:
https://github.com/bitcolorine/Je-suis-eclectique
and the site here: http://bitcolorine.github.io/Je-suis-eclectique/

Any help would be appreciated. I am very determined to build my site and a few others for my projects. 
Thanks.

Hey @bitcolorine! If your site is not updating every time you push, it&#x27;s probably because the build is broken. If this is the case, you&#x27;ll see emails from GitHub.

Everything in your repo looks fine and seems to build properly for me. :+1:
