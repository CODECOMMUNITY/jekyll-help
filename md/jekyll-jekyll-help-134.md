# [Trouble deploying to Heroku](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/pull/134)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Hello,
I&#x27;ve had a hell of a time trying to get Jekyll to run on Heroku. I followed the link for getting it to run with Rack 
http://blog.crowdint.com/2010/08/02/instant-blog-using-jekyll-and-heroku.html but it didn&#x27;t work and the article is over four years old. Right now I&#x27;m getting &quot;Push rejected, no Cedar-supported app detected&quot; but at one point I could push to it but the logs said it crashed without giving a useful reason.

I don&#x27;t know Rack or Ruby so this has been a very frustrating experience. I&#x27;ve tried several different tutorials on getting Jekyll to run on heroku but nothing has worked. Eventually I need to get this running on EC2... I hope it&#x27;s not another six hours of work. Please help, this is driving me insane.

Even the static site files by themselves would be fine really.

I&#x27;m not quite sure why this is a pull request.

Please create a [fresh issue](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/new) for help getting up and running on Heroku.

Okay, I thought the following applied to this situation.
&quot;Have some code that isn&#x27;t working? Fork this repo, add your code to a feature branch, push up and create a pull request. Anyone who sees your PR can comment on your code: &quot;Hey, you forgot a curly bracket here!&quot;&quot;
Oh wait, does that mean a PR within the fork?

Oh, I completely forgot about that. Sorry. We should continue the discussion in #135 though. If this source is available on GitHub, please provide a link to that repo.
