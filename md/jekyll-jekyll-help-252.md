# [How to write a new data generation feature + test](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/252)

> state: **open** opened by: **** on: ****

Hi,

I need to use a mongodb like it would be a json data file and plan to write a new feature for it.
However I didn&#x27;t find the place where the _data readers are implemented.

Can you give a brief oversight about what would needed to be done to create such a feature and how it would be properly tested (speaking of server dependency) so it would be accepted in the jekyll project?

Thanks!
