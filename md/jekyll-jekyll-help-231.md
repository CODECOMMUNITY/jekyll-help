# [Robomongo installation troubles](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/231)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

Hi,
I just downloaded the file robomongo-0.8.4-x86_64.deb and I installed it on my pc with Ubuntu 12.04.
Everything supposedly went fine, but when I try to use robomongo I get the following message:

/usr/bin/robomongo: riga 16:  8842 Errore di segmentazione (core dump creato) &quot;$ROBO_DIR/robomongo&quot;
 
roughly translatable with:

/usr/bin/robomongo: row 16:  8842 Segmentation error (core dump created) &quot;$ROBO_DIR/robomongo&quot;

can anyone help me?

Thank you.

s.

Does this have to do with Jekyll at all? Sorry, but we can&#x27;t be a general
tech support repo...
