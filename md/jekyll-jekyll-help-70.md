Where can I find a documented list of the configuration options?
[The one on the main website](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) doesn&#x27;t contain them all, and the explanations are not very clear.

I&#x27;ve got the feeling that some of those pages are not really up to date, e.g. the [upgrade notes](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/), that talk about version &#x60;1.0&#x60;.


At the moment I&#x27;m trying to figure out what&#x27;s the purpose of the &#x60;url&#x60; option, which doesn&#x27;t seem to have any effect.
Is it just some kind of meta-data to be referenced in the other pages?

Yes, &#x60;url&#x60; has no meaning â€“ it&#x27;s just a piece of metadata. Sorry that wasn&#x27;t clear!

Thank you for confirming this!
Does this mean that the main website is still the most _authoritative_ source of documentation?  

I&#x27;m still in the process of understanding how the configuration options work.

In the case of &#x60;url&#x60; is this a correct way to use it?

&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;html
&lt;a href=&quot;{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}&quot;&gt;
  {{ post.title }}
&lt;/a&gt;
&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
Os is there a more straightforward way to reference it?

Yes yes yes! What the line you posted does is output the post URL, then prepend it with two metadata pieces: the baseurl (i.e. &#x60;/hi&#x60; in &#x60;http://example.org/hi&#x60;) and the site&#x27;s URL, (i.e. &#x60;http://example.org&#x60; in &#x60;http://example.org/hi&#x60;). You can set these in the &#x60;_config.yml&#x60; file, but both are optional. They&#x27;re there so that if your site requires a base url or the full URL, you don&#x27;t have to change the templates, just the configuration file.
