# [Jekyll Planet?](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/109)

> state: **open** opened by: **** on: ****

No doubt this has already been mentioned or suggested somewhere, so please feel free to direct me to that spot to contribute... 

Quick questions/ideas: 

+ I&#x27;m often on the lookout for news &amp; information (blog posts, articles, videos, etc.) about Jekyll and Jekyll-related projects (Prose.io, etc.), but there&#x27;s no single &quot;feed&quot; of that information that I can subscribe to / check-in on from time-to-time

+ When I&#x27;m NOT actively hunting for news &amp; information about Jekyll, I&#x27;m occasionally producing news &amp; information that talks about Jekyll (or static site generators in general) and it would be great if there were a place to contribute that (e.g., http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/staticnewsapps/ )

The &quot;News&quot; section on the Jekyll site seems to just focus on releases. The &quot;Resources&quot; section might be the place, if pull requests are encouraged against it, but perhaps its best left as a curated &quot;best of&quot; resources list... 

Thus, I&#x27;m really asking about a less curated stream of what everyone is thinking and doing with Jekyll. Useful? Already underway? Best place for it?

Phillip.

[Development Seed](http://developmentseed.org/blog/) are at the forefront of Jekyll and keep inventing many of the best tools for Jekyll, so you should definitely follow them for what’s what in Jekyll.

Phillip, - I&#x27;ve just been reading some of your posts. Great stuff. 

So I started something. I built this a while back, but did nothing with it, but seems like there is a need, as you point out, so I resurrected it this morning. It&#x27;s not specific to Jekyll, because my view is that any of the static site generators are tools to be chosen for a job, but as I&#x27;m a big Jekyll user, it will be a focus of coverage.

There&#x27;s still much to be done, but I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think: http://www.thenewdynamic.com/

Phillip - this is an excellent idea. I&#x27;d love to see it happen.

@ndarville Yes, indeed, Development Seed are doing amazing stuff. However, they&#x27;ve not posted much recently, whereas many others have been posting really interesting articles about the features in newer version of Jekyll -- that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m keen to have a feed of. :)

@budparr Having a look now...

@parkr :+1: 

(Thanks for the comments!)

@budparr Looking good. Curious where you see it going? Would people need to submit a pull request for each link, post, resource, etc.?

For posts, probably, but I think I&#x27;ll do something a bit speedier for links, resources (which are now yaml files) like pull in from the delicious or Tumblr api. As long as i can do filtering and search on them. Open to suggestions

Hmmm... thinking this through: if posts are not automatically added -- based on a feed or something -- then it&#x27;s not really a planet is it? 

I was thinking something more along the lines of: http://planet.mozilla.org/  You know, a &quot;river of news&quot; on a topic. 

Maybe there&#x27;s not enough posts for that to make sense? But then again...

So far the site that I put together has been more about the process of thinking about this than anything.

I&#x27;m thinking of something like Tumblr, which can be open to contributors and quick and easy to add a link, yet gives it a bit of curation that I think is needed. 

Without curation there&#x27;s a lot of potential noise, including, for instance all the other Jekyll stuff out there (Jekyll Island, Jekyll and Hyde, Jekyll and Hide), and all the blog posts like &quot;why [or how] I switched from Wordpress to Jekyll&quot; which have no value. The issue there is that I&#x27;d like everything to be filterable and searchable on the site, and that would include site content as well as the Tumblr stream.

Of course, my conception is to not concentrate solely on Jekyll because, as you demonstrate on your series of posts, there&#x27;s a lot going on in the &quot;static&quot; space. Jekyll would be a filterable item, so anyone interested in just that one would easily be able to just see that content.

I hear you re: curation, but also have experienced when curation A) filters out relevant content and B) runs out of steam and the site dies a slow death.

The upside to a Planet, IMHO, is that it&#x27;s unfiltered by default. Filtering on topic of the stream then gives the user the exact amount of precision they&#x27;d like. 

For example, I don&#x27;t mind the &quot;I just migrated to Jekyll&quot; posts, because they point out new people coming into the Jekyll space and possibly solving new problems. 

There&#x27;s no issue with Jekyll and Hyde use case, because a planet is made up of narrow streams -- e.g., http://phillipadsmith.com/tag/jekyll/  -- and is not consuming a public search for &quot;Jekyll&quot; across various sources. 

I hear you re: curation, but personally seek something less filtered and more real-time.

Keep the thought process going. Good stuff. :)

well isn&#x27;t a today&#x27;s version of planet mozilla (which is an old school RSS aggregator) simply a twitter list? I put a twitter list on the site, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too terribly helpful yet. I&#x27;ve tried broadening the list to people whom I&#x27;ve see post/speak about this stuff, but then there&#x27;s lots of noise there too.

By the way, I think the &quot;River&quot; would be super simple to create: http://builtwith.kimonolabs.com/

For me, they are quite different. 

I don&#x27;t often look to Twitter for information hash tagged with Jekyll.

I do however try to follow certain blogs that post on the topic. 

&gt; I&#x27;ve tried broadening the list to people whom I&#x27;ve see post/speak about this stuff, but then there&#x27;s lots of noise there too.

Most Planets have two or three default filters: A) feed is already filtered by topic, e.g., domain.com/tag/topic.rss, B) feed item contains the term(s) specified, and C) feed is in some language (or filters out some language)

&gt; By the way, I think the &quot;River&quot; would be super simple to create: http://builtwith.kimonolabs.com/

Great. :)  (Though I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m following the difference between a River and a Planet that I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;re trying to describe...?)

Although I can imagine what _river_ and _planet_ mean in this context, would you mind explaining in short what they are so everyone knows what you’re talking about? Thank you. :)

To my mind Planet means the universe of people who are talking about a topic and the river is the resulting stream of content from those people, likely filtered about a topic.

I should back up and say that my concept for the site I built was to have several components with the ultimate aim of promoting and observing the use of static/post-cms tools.

1. Links to news/posts  (&quot;Jekyll Hook gets updated&quot;, etc.)
2. Links to resources (longer shelf-life than 1 above, includes tutorials, how-to posts, and other resources.
3. Perhaps a showcase
4. blog posts with my own or any contributor&#x27;s observations.

I think @phillipadsmith is looking for something like my item 1, but more of a &quot;planet&quot; than my original conception of a curated set of posts.

What do you think about a hacker news type approach for Jekyll world? It could be a simple rails site we put on a Heroku instance with GitHub auth. The curation is then by the users (via upvotes).

What!? @parkr, you can&#x27;t do that with Jekyll?  :-P 

Otherwise, :100:

@parkr Sounds like a great idea! I&#x27;d love to help out.

Jekyll maintainers should also be able to post announcements and the like that are pinned at the top.

Anything you create (the site, not necessarily the content) can also be shared via jekyllrb.com and the &#x60;@jekyll&#x60; twitter project. :+1:

Started some development in [alfredxing/jekyll-news](https://github.com/alfredxing/jekyll-news). It&#x27;s not a Rails project, but a Sinatra one (I like Sinatra a bit better for simpler sites). Not complete yet, of course.

Hello, @phillipadsmith , @parkr, @alfredxing  FYI: I&#x27;m the developer of the Planet Pluto gem (in Ruby). I&#x27;ve setup a Planet Jekyll  (on Heroku) - the feed list is just a text file ([jekyll.ini](https://github.com/feedreader/planet-jekyll)) that gets auto-updated every 24 hours.   The Planet site offers different design/styles/layouts - e.g. [River of News](http://planetjekyll.herokuapp.com/?style=news), [All Top](http://planetjekyll.herokuapp.com/?style=top), [Random](http://planetjekyll.herokuapp.com/?style=random), [Hacker News](http://planetjekyll.herokuapp.com/?style=hacker), [Digest](http://planetjekyll.herokuapp.com/?style=digest), and so on.   Let me know what you think. Of course, you&#x27;re welcome to add more feeds and so on. Cheers.

@phillipadsmith  Thanks for your kind words. If you&#x27;re interested I&#x27;ve added you to the editors team - github will send you an invitation -  if you&#x27;re interested you can change the planet config without pull request, for example, in your browser - you will have commit/write access). Cheers.
