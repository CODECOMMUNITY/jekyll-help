Where would the favicon be placed in a Jekyll site run by GitHub Pages?  Is the code to be placed in the .html in _site?  I have used this website http://realfavicongenerator.net to generate the favicons.

Hello, you place the file on the root folder of your project, it will be copied to the &#x60;_site&#x60; directory on generation!

Is it possible to use all the favicons that the generator created?

Wikipedia has a surprisingly good [implementation guide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Browser_implementation) for favicons.
