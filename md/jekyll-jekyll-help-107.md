# [_site shows .md instead of .html files](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-help/issues/107)

> state: **closed** opened by: **** on: ****

when checking the content of _site generated by the &#x27;jekyll build&#x27; I noticed that all the files have the .md extensions instead of the expected .html.
Ideas of how to fix that?

How do your source files look like? .md files as well?

Please post the contents of an example file. Especially how your front matter looks like, etc.

There is an extra &#x27;white space&#x27; after the &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;---&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;.
When removed the problem is solved.
